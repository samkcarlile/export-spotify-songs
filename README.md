# export-spotify-songs
A tool to export Spotify songs to a text file.

##How to use
1. Open Spotify and select all the songs in a playlist or whatever by clicking on the top song, scrolling to the bottom, and Shift+clicking the bottom song.
2. Copy and paste this into a text file. It will be a list of Spotify URIs. Name the file "spotify-songs.txt" (or edit the program and you can name it whatever you'd like.)
3. Run the program and it will output a file with each song in the format "Song Name | Artist[,Artist...]"
